Such a spectrum reflect the fact that the eigenstates are mostly localized by the strong potential. On the other hand, if we take $t$ as the dominant term, the spectrum then looks like a series of quadratic functions. This is consistent with the fact that the system is periodic and the electrons are nearly free. \n",
